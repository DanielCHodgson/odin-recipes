<h2>Decription</h2>
<p>
    This is how you make beans on toast. A perfect filler for your belly and for this website.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Tin of beans. Preferably Branston.</li>
    <li>Thick cut white bread. Preferably the synthetic Warburtons toastie type.</li>
    <li>Butter.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>
        Add the beans to a saucepan and heat gently, stirring so the beans don't stick to the bottom.
    </li>
    <li>
        Meanwhile, add the bread to a toaster and toast until desired doneness. At least to a deep golden colour all over (anaemic toast enjoyers deserve the gulag).    
    </li>
    <li>
        Once the toast is done, butter it and slice diagonally. Diagonally slicing bread significantly improves the flavour.
    </li>
    <li>
        Once the beans are piping hot, add to the buttered toast.
    </li>
</ol>
