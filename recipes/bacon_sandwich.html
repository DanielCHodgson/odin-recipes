<h2>Decription</h2>
<p>
    This is how you make a perfect bacon sandwhich. Period. Fact. Undesputable. And before you start, I don't wanna hear it. Just follow the damn recipe.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3 slices of thick cut smoked back bacon OR 5 slices of thin cut smoked back bacon.</li>
    <li>Thick cut fresh bread of choice. A crusty cob is king.</li>
    <li>Butter.</li>
    <li>Ketchup and / or brown sauce. I won't judge.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>
        Line a baking sheet with tinfoil (the good kind, the cheap stuff is a false economy), then lay out the bacon. Make sure to leave a little room between slices so the bacon has maximum surface area with the baking sheet.
    </li>
    <li>
        Add the baking sheet to a cold oven (this will give the fat time to render) and set to 200 fan. 
    </li>
    <li>
        Cook for 15-20 minutes depending on your bacon thickness. It may need even longer depending on how crispy you like it.
    </li>
    <li>
        If needed, drain any excess liquid from the baking sheet halfway through cooking. The lower quality of bacon the higher chance it'll give out a load of brine which will stop your bacon crisping.
    </li>
    <li>
        While the bacon is cooking, butter the bread and add your condiments.
    </li>
    <li>
        Once the bacon has reached your desired crisp level (it better have crisp, anaemic bacon enjoyers deserve the gulag), remove from the oven.
    </li>
    <li>
        Assemble the sandwich and slice diagonally (this significantly improves the taste). However, a vertical slice is recommended if this would result in a more geomertically balanced sandwich than a diagonal.
    </li>
</ol>
