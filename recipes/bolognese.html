               <h2>Steps</h2>
           
               <h3>Make the ragu</h3>
               <ol>
                   <li>
                       Prepare the Meat Sauce: Heat olive oil in a large pan over medium heat. Add diced pancetta, cooking until
                       crispy. Add carrots, onion, and celery, and sauté until softened.
                   </li>
                   <li>
                       the Beef: Add the ground beef to the pan, breaking it apart and cooking until browned.
                   </li>
                   <li>
                       Add Tomato and Wine: Stir in tomato puree, cooking for 2 minutes. Pour in red wine and let it reduce by
                       half.
                   </li>
           
                   <li>Simmer: Add beef stock, canned tomatoes, and chopped basil. Simmer for 30-40 minutes. Gradually stir in milk
                       to
                       add creaminess. Season with salt and pepper.
                   </li>
               </ol>
               <h3>Make the white sauce</h3>
               <ol>
                   <li>
                       melt the butter in a saucepan, then stir in the flour for a couple of minutes to cook off the raw taste.
                   </li>
                   <li>
                       Slowly add the milk and constantly whisk on medium heat until the sauce consistency coats the back of a
                       spoon.
                   </li>
                   <li>
                       Add the nutmeg and season with salt and pepper.
                   </li>
               </ol>
               <h3> Assemble and bake</h3>
               <ol>
                   <li>
                       Layer the lasagna in a baking dish starting with ragu, then lasagna sheets, then white sauce, and
                       repeat.
                   </li>
                   <li>
                       Top the final layer of white sauce with mozeralla and parmasan.
                   </li>
                   <li>
                       Bake in the oven at 200 for about 30 minutes. If the top layer starts to overcook, cover the lasagna
                       with tinfoil.
                   </li>
                   <li>
                       Let rest for at least 15 minutes before slicing and serving.
                   </li>
